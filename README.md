Simple Library for Mathematics for 2D Graphics

So far I have implemented:

>Vector2D
>>Simple Class for handling Vectors and Points (maybe needs third component and new class for Points)
>Matrix2D
>>Simple Class for 3x3 Matrices needed (now is column major representation and multiplying with a vector by either side has the same effect)
>Polygons
>>Simple Classes for Simple Polygon Objects (PolyLine, Polygon2D, Rectanlge, Triangle)
>LinearShapes
>>Simple Classes for Basic Linear Shapes (Line, Ray, Segment)
>Distances2D
>>Basic Distance between Polygons and Linear Shapes etc..


So far I have tested and are working properly:

>>Vector2D
>>Matrix2D


I am currently working on this little library and will be pushing more updated stuff. Any suggestions of course are more than welcomed.
