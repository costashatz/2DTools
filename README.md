##Simple Library for Mathematics for 2D Graphics

#So far I have implemented:

1. Vector2D
..* Simple Class for handling Vectors and Points (maybe needs third component and new class for Points)
2. Matrix2D
..* Simple Class for 3x3 Matrices needed (now is column major representation and multiplying with a vector by either side has the same effect)
3. Polygons
..* Simple Classes for Simple Polygon Objects (PolyLine, Polygon2D, Rectanlge, Triangle)
4. LinearShapes
..* Simple Classes for Basic Linear Shapes (Line, Ray, Segment)
5. Distances2D
..* Basic Distance between Polygons and Linear Shapes etc..


#So far I have tested and are working properly:

1. Vector2D
2. Matrix2D


# WORK IN PROGRESS - WILL BE UPDATED FREQUENTLY

I am currently working on this little library and will be pushing more updated stuff. Any suggestions of course are more than welcomed.
