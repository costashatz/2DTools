###Simple Mathematics Library for 2D Graphics

####So far I have implemented:

1. Vector2D
    * Simple Class for handling Vectors and Points (maybe needs third component and new class for Points)
2. Matrix2D
    * Simple Class for 3x3 Matrices needed (now is column major representation and multiplying with a vector by either side has the same effect)
3. Polygons
    * Simple Classes for Simple Polygon Objects (PolyLine, Polygon2D, Rectanlge, Triangle)
4. LinearShapes
    * Simple Classes for Basic Linear Shapes (Line, Ray, Segment)
5. Distances2D
    * Distances between Polygons and Linear Shapes etc..

####Planning to implement:

1. Intersections2D
    * Find intersections (intersection area, points, true/false) between all the 2D primitives/shapes above
2. Quadratic Curves
    * Circles
    * Ellipses
3. Polynomial Curves
    * Bezier
    * B-Spline
    * NURBS
4. BSP Trees in 2D
5. Miscellaneous Topics in 2D
    * Convex Hulls
    * Triangulation
    * Area/Volume Measurement

####So far I have tested and are working properly:

1. Vector2D
2. Matrix2D
3. LinearShapes
4. Polygons


####WORK IN PROGRESS - WILL BE UPDATED FREQUENTLY

I am currently working on this little library and will be pushing more updated stuff. Any suggestions of course are more than welcomed.
